# password-generator
This repo holds the challenge for my third module where I created a password generator based off a small ammount of starter code.

In this challenge I worked on my skills with Javascript and integrating Javascript with CSS and HTML. I practiced the following skills:
- Using arrays
- Using functions
- Using for loops
- Using while loops
- Using conditional statements
- Using NaN
- Using an addEventListener to change the HTML text
